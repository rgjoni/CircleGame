# CircleGame MacOS!
This is a game I created to be ran in terminal.

# How to Run!
This game works best in the native terminal.
To Run:
1. Clone the Repository
2. g++ CircleGame.cpp -lncurses
3. ./a.out   

# Rules:
Use the Left or Right keys to get to the number in the middle before time runs out
You have 3 lives if you hit the wrong number or times runs out you loose a life.
